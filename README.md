# HyPE: Harnessing Hyperbolic Geometry for Harmful Prompt Detection and Sanitization

A research project page for the paper "Harnessing Hyperbolic Geometry for Harmful Prompt Detection and Sanitization" accepted at ICLR 2026.

## About

This repository contains the project page for HyPE and HyPS, two frameworks for detecting and sanitizing malicious or harmful prompts in Vision-Language Models. 

- **HyPE** (Hyperbolic Prompt Espial): A lightweight anomaly detector using hyperbolic geometry;
- **HyPS** (Hyperbolic Prompt Sanitization): An interpretable sanitization method using attribution and LLM-based rewriting.
